Spring Cloud Stream App Starters for integrating with python

This component runs a single Jython script that binds `payload` and `headers` variables to the Message payload and headers respectively. 
In addition you may provide the `jython.variables` property to a comma delimited string `var1=val1,var2=val2,...` 

[NOTE]
====
The last line in the script must be an assignment statement. The variable name doesn't matter. This is always true when working with Jython with any of these apps.
