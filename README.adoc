Spring Cloud Stream App Starters for integrating with Python

## Provisioning Python Resources

Each of these applications in the Python family include configuration properties that specify Python script locations and directories. These properties use Spring's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/resources.html[Resource] abstraction.  Python script and directory locations reference to a local file  or URL resources (e.g. http). 

Classpath resources are intentionally not supported as it would require a Python developer to package Pyhton scripts in the jar. 
If you provide a `git.url` to a repository, the application will clone the repository to the local file system during initialization and load scripts from there.  For local file system scripts (including a Git clone), if `requirements.txt` exists in the base directory, the application will `pip install` any Python dependencies. If you are running on Cloud Foundry, you need to use the link:docs/JavaPythonBuildPack.adoc[Java Python buildpack].

[NOTE]
----
Conda apps require prior Conda to be installed on the local host. 
When running on Cloud Foundry, the Java Python buildpack will install the Conda environment per `environment.yml`.
