Spring Cloud Stream App Starters for integrating with Python


To learn more about these application and the supported properties, please review the following links.


# Accessing Python Resources

These applications include configuration properties that specify Python script locations and directories. These
properties use Spring's
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/resources.html[Resource] abstraction.

Python scripts may be packaged in the Jar file as classpath resources, or may point to a local file using the `file:`
Resource protocol.  URL resources such as https://raw.githubusercontent
.com/dturanski/python-apps/master/test-wrappers/upper.py are supported. Additionally if you provide a `git.url` to
a valid repository, the application will clone the repository to the local file system during initialization and load
 scripts from there.



# Python via Http

These applications provide a simple way to integrate with an external Python application exposed as an http service.
This will technically work with any http service. It is a specialized implementation of the
https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/httpclient[httpclient]
processor that provides support for local execution of a Python wrapper script via an embedded Jython ScriptEngine to
transform data in and out of the http server.

## Jython Processor

# Python Local Process

These applications install and run an external Python application in the local container.

## Python Local Sink

## Prerequisites

These applications install and run an external Python application in the local container. These applications typically 
import https://pypi.python.org/pypi/springcloudstream[springcloudstream] to handle low level I/O. Simply provide a
single argument Function that returns a value. Both the argument and return value must be `str` types.

For example

```python
from springcloudstream.stream import Processor

def echo(data):
    return data


process = Processor()
process.start(echo)
```

The application requires that Python (2.7 or 3) is installed along with Java in the local container or server.

* Standalone - Install Python per instructions for your OS.
* CloudFoundry - Use the https://github.com/dturanski/java-python-buildpack[java-python-buildpack].
* Docker - Use one of the of the java-python images https://hub.docker.com/u/korekontrol/[here],

The application will invoke `pip` to install any dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` in the top level
directory. This must include the line  `springcloudstream>=1.0`.
