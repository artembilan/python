Spring Cloud Stream App Starters for integrating with Python

=== Provisioning Python Resources

Each of these applications in the Python family include configuration properties that specify Python script locations and directories.
These properties use Spring's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/resources.html[Resource] abstraction.
Python script and directory locations reference to a local file  or URL resources (e.g. http).

Classpath resources are intentionally not supported as it would require a Python developer to package Pyhton scripts in the jar. 
If you provide a `git.url` to a repository, the application will clone the repository to the local file system during initialization and load scripts from there.
